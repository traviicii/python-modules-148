# Python Modules

# Modules in Python : Modules in Python are either built-in toolboxes, or toolboxes we build ourselves and import into projects that need them

# Modules typically contain functions, variables, and classes

# import helper

# helper.d()
# helper.help()

# Why? 

#-- Efficiency : Why build something, or repeatedly build something, when it's already been done once, or already exists
#-- Organized : Keeping things tidy and separating our concerns into their own designated spots
#-- Resusability : Recycling your tools
